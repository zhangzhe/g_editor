textile is just a textile editor, it original from redmine: http://www.redmine.org/
Added color and code functions which need for my demand. It is not exactly textile, I made some change to make edit simplier.
Example see: http://zhangzhe.heroku.com/example/textile, and here is an instruction: http://zhangzhe.heroku.com/blogs/11-Textile-WYSIWYG-editor.
